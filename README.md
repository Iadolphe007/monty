# Project Name: Stack and Queue Operations - LIFO, FIFO

This project implements various opcode operations for manipulating a stack and queue data structure. The supported operations include **push**, **pall**, **pint**, **pop**, **swap**, **add**, and **nop**.

## **Usage**
The project provides the following opcode operations:

### **push**
The `push` opcode allows you to push an integer element onto the stack.

Usage: `push <int>`

### **pall**
The `pall` opcode prints all the elements in the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

Usage: `pall`

### **pint**
The `pint` opcode prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: `pint`

### **pop**
The `pop` opcode removes the top element from the stack.

Usage: `pop`

### **swap**
The `swap` opcode swaps the positions of the top two elements in the stack.

Usage: `swap`

### **add**
The `add` opcode performs addition on the top two elements of the stack, replacing them with the sum.

Usage: `add`

### **nop**
The `nop` opcode does not perform any operation. It is a no-op.

Usage: `nop`

Note that the stack follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, and the queue follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.
